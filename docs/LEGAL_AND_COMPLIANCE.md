All interactions beyond the platform, including in-person meetings, are conducted **solely at users’ own discretion and responsibility**.

## 2. Assumption of Risk & User Responsibility

By using JJ-Meet, users acknowledge and agree that:
- Meeting new people involves inherent personal, safety, and social risks

JJ-Meet provides safety tools and reporting mechanisms but **does not replace personal judgment or caution**.
